# Battleships - Unity Multiplayer Game Demo
This project is all about multiplayer games and working with servers and databases!
I'm creating a multiplayer game in a Unity URP project where players each have a boat which they can control, and have to shoot down other player's boats.

## My goals for the project
- Good graphics
- Smooth controls
- Realistic features
- Connecting devices to host
- Connecting devices to server
- Saving data in database
- Secure connections between devices
